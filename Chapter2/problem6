# Least distance sorting: If there are 20

# statues are moved the least distance.
#********************************************

Given a row of statues, you compare the first two, and if the
one on the right is shorter, you swap them.  Then you compare
what is now the second and third statue, and if the third statue
is shorter, you swap them, and you continue comparing to the 
left until the statue on the left of the comparison is no longer
taller than the right of the comparison.  Now if the third statue
had been taller than the second, you would have simply moved on to the
fourth statue and compared it to the third.  This process will
continuously push the shorter statues to the left while moving them
a minimal distance, but the algorithm is very slow and inefficient.
