#***************************************************
# Given 25 horses, and being only able to race them
# five at a time, how many races are necessary to
# find the three fastest horses?
#***************************************************

To begin, you can hold 5 races between the 25 horses.
Then of the 5 winners, you can hold another race to 
put the 5 groups in order of fastest to slowest.
The winner of the 5 fastest horses is obviously the fastest
of the 25.  The next two fastest could either be the
second and third of the 5 fastest horses, or they could be
any of the 2nd-3rd of the fastest group, the 1st-2nd of the
second fastest group. or the fastest of the 3rd group.  This
narrows down the pool to another 5 horses, and another match
will produce the second fastest and third fastest of the 25 horses.
This process will take 7 races.
