To find the best player, you take two players initially, and 
have a match to find who is the stronger player.  Then the winner
continues on to play a third player, and the winner of that second
match goes on to play a fourth player.  Keeping this pattern on to
the end will result in finding the best player.  This will take
N - 1 comparisons.


To find the two best players, you split the N players into pairs, 
resulting in N/2 matches.  Then taking the winners of those matches,
you can again pair them up (another N/4 matches), and find the winners.
Pairing the winners again up until the final two players will produce
the best and second best players. This results in N - 1 matches.
This can be easily seen with the case of 8 players, where you first
have 4 matches (total: 4), then of the 4 matches, you proceed to 2 more 
matches between the winners of the 4 matches (total: 6), followed by 
a final match between the winners of the previous two matches (total: 7).
